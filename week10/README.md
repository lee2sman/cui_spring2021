### Activity: Building a VUI game

Today we'll be making a VUI game. Drawing on our previous experience throughout the semester to make text user interfaces, then graphic user interfaces, and now voice user interfaces students will work in teams to create a compelling game playable via voice user interface.

Categories:
- a quiz game
- a choose-your-own-adventure style branching narrative game
- a "facts" application
- a gambling game
- something else!

Process:

Talk. What are you interested in? What questions do you have? Can you come to an agreement on something you are excited about? What kinds of skills do you have and what will you need to learn?

What's your working process? (Suggestion: Do a flowchart first. Then create a spreadsheet of utterances)

Your final game must include:

- a playable game!
- an introduction
- "help"
- "credits" - listing everyone involved
- a way to reset - e.g. "start over"
- win/lose conditions
- suggestions for what to do in case the VUI doesn't understand what someone said

**Important: to be considered complete each student should include a link to the final project, list your name, and list your collaborators. Address: How does your program work? How did you work collaboratively? (What roles did people take, if any). What challenges did you find? And anything else about the process. 1 to 3 paragraphs**

## Homework
